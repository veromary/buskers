Music in the style of buskers books - melody and chords

The kick to get this started comes from looking for Christmas Carols arranged for Ukulele for a child.  So many online freebies align the chord names above the lyrics, but no melody line.

Mr Bloomfield has a wonderful [collection of Christmas Carols](http://acollectionofchristmascarols.com) in traditional SATB arrangement.

As the tunes and lyrics are there in lilypond files, it should be fairly easy to adapt for melody only editions, then just a case of adding chords.

I will tend to simplify the chords.

It would be easy to make versions for guitar chords too.

Maybe recorder group arrangements are possible.

Happy music-making!
